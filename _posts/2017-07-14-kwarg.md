title:  What the **kwargs ?
tags:   [python]

**THIS ARTICLE IS A TEST, DON'T MIND THE CONTENT.**

Ever heard of ****kwargs** ? Or ***args** or **optional arguments** ?

## 1. Optional arguments

{% highlight python %}
def fun(name, age=42):
  print("You're {0} and are {1} years old.".format(name, age))
{% endhighlight %}

The argument *name* is mandatory, *age* not. If not given, the default value will be used (here it's *42*).

*Example*:
{% highlight python %}
# Call with age
fun('arthur', 20)
# > You're arthur and are 20 years old.

# Call without age
fun('Uncle Ben')
# > You're Uncle Ben and are 42 years old.
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. *args

**args* allow to give a list of arguments, it will be wrapped in a *tuple*. Therefore the function's number of argument can vary.

Let's build a function that takes all your favorite colors, and display their name.
{% highlight python %}
def color(*args):
  for co in args:
    print('You like the color {0}.'.format(co))
{% endhighlight %}

*Example*:
{% highlight python %}
color('blue', 'yellow')
# > You like the color blue.
# > You like the color yellow.

color('red')
# > You like the color red.
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. **kwargs

***kwargs* is quite similar to **args*, but instead of taking a list of arguments, it takes pair of key/value (as a python dictionary).

Let's build a function that takes pairs of country/capital and display them:
{% highlight python %}
def geography(**kwargs):
  for country, capital in kwargs.items():
    print('{0} has for capital {1}.'.format(country, capital))
{% endhighlight %}

*Example*:
{% highlight python %}
geography(England = 'London', France = 'Paris')
# > France has for capital Paris.
# > England has for capital London.
{% endhighlight %}

**Nota Bene**: *You may have notice that France appeared before England (No, no i didn't make it on purpose). Remember that dict in Python should be seen as unordered.*
