      <description>PhD Grind (pdf url) is not strictly speaking a book, but rather a pdf memoir. It is the story of a PhD, during its six long years, in the USA in Computer Science (Model checking &amp;amp; HCI).
I found this book fantastic. As a first-year PhD, it really talked to me. I was interested to discover the PhD system in the USA, which sounds quite different from what I know in France.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning</title>

      <description>Ball Lightning is an early book of Cixin Liu, the Three-Body Problem trilogy author. While not as good as its trilogy, the book was interesting to read because of its theme: Science.
The protagonists try to understand the ball lightning (a real phenomenon). The whole book is structured around their experiments, their thoughts, and failures. The end of the book goes a bit far, and is clearly &amp;ldquo;science-fiction&amp;rdquo;, but still in a &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo;, plausible way.</description>

      <description>This book is cataloged as sci-fi, and it actually won a Nebula and Hugo prize, so good sci-fi it should be. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t like sci-fi, give it a try anyway. Published in 1959, the book epoch doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter and except a few details it could happen right now in the 2020&amp;rsquo;s.
The narrator, Charly Gordon, is mentally disabled with a IQ in the 80 range, and we read the regular reports he write.</description>

      <description>This french book title can be translated as &amp;ldquo;Love dictated by algorithms&amp;rdquo;. It talks about a real woman reporter who, after a bad breakup, started using Tinder, and one thing leading to the other, ended investigating what was behind Tinder&amp;rsquo;s algorithms.
Overall, I was disappointed as I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn much about the algorithms, probably not the fault of the reporter as a lot is hidden by Tinder company. To summarize, every Tinder user has an ELO score.</description>

      <description>The most prestigious prize of french literature, the Goncourt prize, was awarded in 2021 for this book. The subject of the book is about a lost african writer author of a mythical book decades ago. Ironically, it won in final against &amp;ldquo;Le voyant d&amp;rsquo;Etampes&amp;rdquo;, whose base synopsis is the same.
This book is well written, with a vocabulary ranging from the vulgar to rare words (I&amp;rsquo;d not recommend this book if you&amp;rsquo;re not fluent in french).</description>

      <description>I love memory. I did a lot of work on Anki flashcards for humans to remember better (here) and my PhD thesis is about making artificial neural networks to avoid forgetting (there).
This book is about a reporter, Joshua, who watched once the US championship on memory. Joshua was at first surprised that some people spent a lot of time to compete in a rather useless challenges (e.g. remember a long string of random digits).</description>

      <description>This is the story of a father and his son. Coming from Beijing, they come to London with different goals. The son hopes to learn and to held a business, the father just follow the stream.
The story itself isn&amp;rsquo;t very interesting. What I liked in this book was the description of racism and inter-generational gap.
English men are deeply racist against Chinese men, but the latter &amp;mdash;especially the old generation&amp;ndash; also hold preconceived ideas on the western culture.</description>

      <description>First book of Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini, the story starts in an Afghanistan I&amp;rsquo;ve never known: not particularly rich, but stable, with movies, and a relative religion liberty. The narrator, son of a rich merchant, is unsufferable but his behavior as a young man will become a burden to the man he&amp;rsquo;ll become. And this burden will have to be lifted through the adversity of the Talibans.
Characters are realistic and their story in chaos that follow the coup dethroning the king is poignant.</description>

      <description>I have been recommended often Zweig, and I recently started to learn more seriously chess. Therefore, the first book I read written by Zweig shall be &amp;ldquo;The Royal Game&amp;rdquo;, a book about the madness induced by chess to an ordinary man.
The style is simple to follow, and the excitation created by the parties the characters engage into is contagious.</description>

      <description>Except the Sun Tzu&amp;rsquo;s Art of War, the Three-Body Problem first tome was my first Chinese book. The first book set the tone, starting in communist-era in the 70s.
When I introduce this trilogy to friends, I often say &amp;mdash;no spoilers:
 Several of world best theoretical physicists suicide. They all leave a note, saying in substance: &amp;ldquo;Physic doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;rdquo;.
 You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more to go buy this book.</description>

      <description>This is a Sci-Fi book, but I think it could also be classified in the recent trend of books talking about Sci-Fi for readers not necessarily accustomed to this domain (I think about the recent french book &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;anomalie&amp;rdquo; but also a tweet from Noah Smith).
The story is about two women, belonging to different allegiances. One, called Blue, belongs to the Garden, a futuristic society that exploited the power of Nature.</description>

      <title>Very Short Introduction: Food</title>

      <description>Very Short Introduction (VSI) is an Oxford collection about various subjects, ranging from humanities (arts, religion, politics, etc.) to very technical field (neuroscience, physics, etc.). With a small format (~100 pages), they aim to be a good introduction.
VSI: Food fulfills perfectly this mission. The book is simple enough for a neophyte in food to understand, and still manages to cover a wide breadth of topics, all centered around food. It&amp;rsquo;s far easier than its cousin VSI: Nutrition.</description>
